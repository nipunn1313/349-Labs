# Running Gumstix on [QEMU](http://qemu.org/)
# Alex Crichton, October 2011

QEMU is an emulator which can simulate the ARM processor on other processors.
The gumstix platform can be simulated on QEMU to provide enhanced debugging
support through GDB. QEMU runs a GDB server, which you then connect to to set
breakpoints, look at registers, etc.

Note that this is not for the faint of heart. The reward of doing this is that
you've got GDB, but it's not exactly easy to set up. Some of these steps require
you to be fairly familiar with unix commands. For me, however, I find GDB
invaluable, especially at the kernel level.

## Getting set up

1. Install QEMU. Afterwards, you should be able to run the `gumstix-system-arm`
   command in a shell (nothing interesting will happen just yet)

1. Install an arm toolchain. You will need this for compilation of your code
   and most machines certainly don't have this by default.
   
   * OSX or Windows - You can find a pre-built toolchain
     [here](http://sourceforge.net/projects/yagarto/files/). Currently, I would
     recommend you use the oldest build they have because that version of GCC
     most closely matches that provided by 349. There may be a few other
     differences, but I have not currently had any problems with this toolchain.
     I couldn't get the newer toolchains to work because when compiling files,
     they would link `_start` as the entry point, but it would not be located
     at `0xa3000000` like you told the linker.

   * Unix - There's probably a tutorial somewhere on the internet
     about getting an arm toolchain. You're going to want a GCC version which
     closely matches 349's version, but it probably doesn't have to be exact.
   
   Your arm toolchain should have some prefix like 'arm-linux-',
   'arm-elf-', 'arm-none-eabi-', or something like that. You'll have to run
   all your `make` commands like

        make CCPREFIX=<prefix>
          
   Finally, make sure your toolchain also has `gdb` with it, because that will
   be used with QEMU. Normal GDB won't work because it will try to disassemble
   ARM opcodes as x86 opcodes.

2. [Download](http://www.contrib.andrew.cmu.edu/~acrichto/flash.img) a flash
   image for qemu, or create it with the instructions below. At this point, you
   should be able to run the following command and see the u-boot prompt

        qemu-system-arm -M verdex -pflash ./flash.img -nographic

3. [Download](http://www.contrib.andrew.cmu.edu/~acrichto/sdcard.img) an
   SD card image, or build your own using the commands below. You should
   now be able to run this command:
   
        qemu-system-arm -M verdex -pflash ./flash.img -nographic -sd sdcard.img

   You should see the u-boot prompt, and if you don't interrupt it, then
   you should see the gumstix prompt. If you poke around the filesystem then
   you should see you've everything in the 349 filesystem.

4. Hook up GDB to QEMU for debugging support. If you start qemu with the `-s`
   flag, then it will create a GDB server which you can then connect to. Start
   a session of your arm toolchain gdb, and run
   
        target remote :1234
  
   And you've connected to qemu! QEMU ceases emulation until you type `continue`
   in gdb, but you can poke around memory and do whatever you like.

## Development workflow

Once you've got qemu, an arm toolchain, and working images, then you can start
compiling your code. You can compile all code on your machine with your arm
toolchain, but then you need to copy files over to the boot partition so u-boot
can use them.

* OSX - just double click on the image file which should mount the FAT partition
        and ignore the ext3 partition. You can then just copy files to/from
        this mount as usual, and even run qemu while it's mounted!

* Unix - I have not tested this at all, but in theory this should work:

        sudo losetup /dev/loop0 sdcard.img
        sudo kpartx -a /dev/loop0
        sudo mount /dev/mapper/loop0p1 /media/bootfs
        
  Now `/media/bootfs` should be the filesystem of the boot partition of the
  SD card. I'm not sure if you'll be able to run qemu with the partition
  mounted, but you can certainly try!

Now your workflow would be:

* Compile
* Copy to boot partition
* Run qemu, interrupting u-boot, and do your `mmcinit/fatload` fun

## Symbolic debugging

It's really useful to have symbolic debugging in GDB so you can type
`break main` instead of `break 0xa292a3ec`. To do this, add the `-g` flag
to the `CFLAGS` variable in your Makefile. This will produce an executable
with debugging symbols enabled. Now in gdb:

    symbol-file path/to/your/kernel

And now you have symbols in GDB! If you're debugging user and kernel level
programs, then you'll have to load a new symbol-file when switching between
the kernel and the user.

## Creating a flash image

The flash image is the original contents of memory when the gumstix boots.
In theory, the flash is ROM. With qemu, however, this isn't enforced at all,
so you may have to re-create the image periodically or redownload it if it gets
corrupted because your code runs wild. Here are the commands to build a flash
image from scratch

    root=http://www.contrib.andrew.cmu.edu/~acrichto

    # The gumstix requires a root filesystem to be available on the image.
    # This is not the same as the one which is provided for 349 use. You can
    # find the original version of this image at
    # http://cumulus.gumstix.org/feeds/current/uclibc/images/gumstix-custom-verdex/
    # as any of the 'jffs2' files.
    wget $root/flash/root_fs_arm.verdex.r1410

    # This is the version of u-boot that is run on the gumstix. The original
    # download can be found at http://cumulus.gumstix.org/feeds/u-boot/
    wget $root/flash/u-boot-verdex-400-r1604.bin

    # This is the kernel provided by 349
    wget $root/flash/uimage

    # Create the image
    dd of=flash.img bs=128k count=256 if=/dev/zero
    dd of=flash.img bs=128k conv=notrunc if=u-boot-verdex-400-r1604.bin
    dd of=flash.img bs=128k conv=notrunc seek=2 if=root_fs_arm.verdex.r1410
    dd of=flash.img bs=128k conv=notrunc seek=248 if=uimage

Even the uimage can be downloaded from the
[pre-built](http://cumulus.gumstix.org/feeds/) downloads page that the
gumstix provides. It's just convenient to use a 349 one.

## Creating an SD card image

There is a tutorial on the gumstix wiki
[here](http://wiki.gumstix.org/index.php?title=Making_qemu_images)
for creating and SD image. I never got these instructions to work out
perfectly, but I was using a questionable unix system to build this
image. Here's what I did that eventually worked:

1. In OSX's Disk Utility program, create a disk image of 100MB formatted as
   MS-DOS (FAT). Don't have any partitions, but have a single partition with
   the GUID partition map. This will create a `.dmg` file.

2. Eject the `.dmg` and using the "Resize image" command at the top, resize
   the image to ~700MB.

3. Re-mount this image and click on the `.dmg` on the column on the left. Now
   click the tab "Partition" and change the partition layout to 2 partitions.
   Give the first partition ~200MB and be sure to format it as MS-DOS (FAT).
   It doesn't matter the name you give it.

4. You now have a two-partition image which you can initialize. I had attempted
   a few times to do this in all unix as well, but I was never able to get 
   u-boot to recognize the sdcard image if I created the partitions in unix

5. The gumstix is expecting a two-partition image which will have one FAT
   bootable partition, and one other ext3 partition with the root filesystem
   that 349 provides. You have a FAT partition, but OSX can't make ext3, so
   transfer this image to a unix machine for the next steps.

6. Assuming your image is named `sdcard.dmg`, execute the following commands:

        sudo losetup /dev/loop0 sdcard.dmg
        sudo kpartx -a /dev/loop0
        sudo mkfs.ext3 /dev/mapper/loop0p2
        sudo mount /dev/mapper/loop0p1 /media/bootfs
        sudo mount /dev/mapper/loop0p2 /media/rootfs
        
        # ... follow 349 instructions to put boot files in /media/bootfs
        # ... follow 349 instructions to put root filesystem in /media/rootfs
        
        sudo umount /media/bootfs
        sudo umount /media/rootfs
        sudo kpartx -d /dev/loop0
        sudo losetup -d /dev/loop0

7. You now have an SD card image! Copy this file to wherever you like for use
   with QEMU.

## Useful things

* [Gumstix Wiki](http://wiki.gumstix.org/index.php?title=Main_Page) - This
  site contains other instructions on how to build different images for the
  gumstix. Not all of it may be 100% accurate, however.

* `man qemu` - look up all of the fancy options qemu's got, especially the GDB
               related ones. I've not gotten the console working, but if you can
               the keyboard/cursor might work a bit better.
